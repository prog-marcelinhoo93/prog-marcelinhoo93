##### 🧠 "Sometimes the process tries to make us forget that the word of God is so much more powerful than what we live in the middle of the process. The fact that you are experiencing a painful process does not mean that God has forgotten your destiny. The process only demonstrates the size of the project that God has in his history". 🧠
